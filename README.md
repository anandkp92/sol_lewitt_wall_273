## Generate Sol LeWitt's Wall Drawing 273
### September 1975

`python get_charts.py [-wall_num <wall_num> -num_lines <num_lines> -size <size]`
* `wall_num`: wall number if you want to paint just one wall
* `num_lines`: number of lines per wall
* `size`: dimension of the drawing

The drawings are saved in a folder called `paintings` (will be created if not presented already).

The artist's guide to generate these drawings can be found [here](https://github.com/anandkp92/sol_lewitt_wall_273/blob/master/instructions.jpg).
